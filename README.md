# 🎬 Movie Rental Analysis Dashboard

## 📝 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Movie Rental Analysis Dashboard** for a video rental business using the well-known **Sakila sample database**. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about customer behavior, film performance, inventory distribution, staff productivity, and operational efficiency.

The analysis was conducted using **SQL for data modeling and transformation**, **Excel for early-stage EDA**, and **Power BI** to build an interactive, visual dashboard. The project is structured using the **MECE framework** to ensure that all aspects of the business are explored clearly and without overlap. It includes a **dashboard file**, **PowerPoint slides**, and a **project report** to summarize findings.
